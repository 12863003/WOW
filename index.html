                    After the release of Warcraft III: frozen throne in 2003, Blizzard Entertainment officially announced the development plan of world of Warcraft (which had been developed secretly for several years). World of Warcraft was publicly tested in North America in 2004 and launched in the United States, New Zealand, Canada, Australia and Mexico on November 23 of the same year. By the end of 2008, the world of Warcraft had more than 11.5 million paid users worldwide, and successfully entered the Guinness Book of world records. In April 2008, the market share of world of Warcraft in MMORPG reached 62%.

                    As long as the flames of war are still burning, heroes of all races will not stop pursuing combat skills. Warriors combine strength, leadership skills, and knowledge of weapons and armor to show their skills in the glorious battle.

                The mission of the Paladin: to help the weak, to uphold justice, and to destroy the evil forces from the darkest corners of the world. These sacred warriors wore plate armor to fight the most powerful enemy. The blessing of the Holy Light allows them to heal wounds and, in some cases, even bring the dead back to life.

                Since ancient times, the call of the wilderness will allow some adventurers to leave the comfort of their homes and venture into the ruthless primitive world. Those who persevere become hunters. They are very familiar with the natural environment, and can hide in the trees like ghosts and lay traps on the path of the enemy.

            <p>
                The creed of the stalker is the contract, and honor can be traded with money. These mercenaries are not bound by conscience and are used to relying on cruel and efficient tactics.

                Pastors are committed to sublimate their spirits and express their unwavering beliefs by benefiting the public. In the past thousands of years, whenever the earth suffered war and allies needed their support, they would put aside their comfortable lives and leave the isolated temple.

            <p>
               Shamans are the guides of the soul, they are not gods, but every element. As the mediator between the earth, fire, water, and air, shamans would call totems to guide the elements to aid their allies or punish those who threatened them.
