                    As long as the flames of war are still burning, heroes of all races will not stop pursuing combat skills. Warriors combine strength, leadership skills, and knowledge of weapons and armor to show their skills in the glorious battle.

                The mission of the Paladin: to help the weak, to uphold justice, and to destroy the evil forces from the darkest corners of the world. These sacred warriors wore plate armor to fight the most powerful enemy. The blessing of the Holy Light allows them to heal wounds and, in some cases, even bring the dead back to life.

                Since ancient times, the call of the wilderness will allow some adventurers to leave the comfort of their homes and venture into the ruthless primitive world. Those who persevere become hunters. They are very familiar with the natural environment, and can hide in the trees like ghosts and lay traps on the path of the enemy.

                The creed of the stalker is the contract, and honor can be traded with money. These mercenaries are not bound by conscience and are used to relying on cruel and efficient tactics.

                Pastors are committed to sublimate their spirits and express their unwavering beliefs by benefiting the public. In the past thousands of years, whenever the earth suffered war and allies needed their support, they would put aside their comfortable lives and leave the isolated temple.

               Shamans are the guides of the soul, they are not gods, but every element. As the mediator between the earth, fire, water, and air, shamans would call totems to guide the elements to aid their allies or punish those who threatened them.

              When facing the power of the devil, most heroes only see death. But the warlock saw only opportunity. Their goal is to control such power, and they have found a means in dark magic. These greedy spellcasters summon demonic servants to fight alongside them.

              Only the most sensitive, intelligent, and disciplined students can embark on the path of a master. The arcane magic that a mage can master is too powerful and dangerous, and only the most dedicated students can see the mystery.

              A few centuries ago, when the Pandaren were still surrendered to the rule of the Mogu tribe, it was the monks who brought some hope for Pandaria's bleak future. Because they were deprived of the right to use weapons by the rulers at the time, the pandas focused on practicing the use of true qi in unarmed combat.

              Druids can harness powerful natural forces to maintain balance and protect life. Experienced druids can vent natural primal energy to enemies, summon the wrath of the astral to hit them from a distance, bind them with strengthened vines, or trap them in the endless whirlwind.

              As a follower of Illidan Stormrage, the Demon Hunter inherited his dark legacy. Both enemies and allies are afraid of their power. Illidari voluntarily accepted fel energy and chaotic magic. It is such energy that has threatened Azeroth for a long time, but they believe it is necessary to fight the Burning Legion.

When the Lich King lost control of the death knight, the former supporters avenged the terrible pressure under his control. After winning the battle of revenge, the death knights found that they had neither a goal nor a home. They entered the world of the living one after another, looking for new goals.
