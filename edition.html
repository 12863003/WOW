            <h2>Burning Crusade</h2>
            <p>
                The doomsday lord Kazzak reopened the dark door to Outland, and the tide of Burning Legion demons swallowed Azeroth. The expeditionary forces of the Horde and Alliance became stronger with the addition of the new races of blood elves and draenei, they passed through the portal to stop the invasion of the Burning Legion from the source. In the dry Hellfire Peninsula of Outland, the Alliance found many heroes who had stationed here through the portal many years ago. At the same time, the Horde also contacted Mag'har. A group of people who did not participate in the initial invasion of Azeroth by their tribe Corruption" orc tribe. The expeditionary force in Outland is arguing over the command of the army and who will serve as the adjutant to Illidan Stormrage, who has taken the shattered territory as his own, causing further conflicts.

            <h2>Wrath of the Lich King</h2>
            <p>
                After only a brief period of peace in the world, the Undead Scourge launched a large-scale attack on the towns of Azeroth. The flames of war hit the Eastern Kingdoms. Facing tremendous pressure against an entire army, Warchief Thrall appointed Garrosh Hellscream to lead the expeditionary force to conquer Northrend. At the same time, the missing human king Varian Wrynn finally returned to Stormwind to regain power. He appointed Bolvar Fortagan to command the same elite Alliance forces to eradicate the Lich King and any tribal forces that dare to block their way.

            <h2>Fission of the earth</h2>
            <p>
                When the triumphant Northrend Expeditionary Army returned to their hometown, they found that all the elemental creatures in Azeroth began to be turbulent. This turmoil signaled the return of the crazy guardian dragon Destroyer Deathwing, who broke ground from the lair in the depths of the elemental plane and tore Azeroth to pieces. As the elemental realm now opens to the world, chaotic elemental creatures and their cruel lords appear one after another, helping the Destroyer and the terrifying Twilight Hammer followers guide the Twilight Judgment: the end of all creatures in Azeroth.

            <h2>Mists of Pandaria</h2>
            <p>
                After the threat of Deathwing was eliminated, Horde Warchief Garrosh Hellscream waited for an opportunity to attack the Alliance and expand the Horde's territory in Kalimdor. The first target was the human city of Theramore in Dustwallow Marsh. After stealing the Blue Dragon’s artifact, Focusing Rainbow, Garrosh Hellscream used a bomb made by Focusing Rainbow to strike Theramore and Sierra. Moro was completely destroyed, and the leader of Dalaran, Ronin, who was involved in the period, died heroically in order to cover Jaina Proudmoore and others, and the old and new hatred between the Alliance and the tribe broke out again, and the war spread across the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the emergence of tribes and alliances not only brought disputes, but more terrifying is that they awakened the terrifying forces buried and under this ancient land, which pandamen call sha, these creatures are transformed from the negative emotions in human hearts. The horrible existence of ‘s gradually corroded the entire continent, and the alliances and tribes that triggered the awakening of the Sha must naturally take on the important mission of bringing Pandaria back to peace. On the other hand, the mantid, which has been enemies of the Pandaren for generations, has gone through a century of Samsara, awakened again, invaded the Great Wall on a large scale, and the Mogu clan of the ancient race was also ready to move, and everything was pushed by a black hand behind the scenes.

            <h2>King of Draenor</h2>
            <p>
                Delano is a vast world full of magma, metal and steam. The furnace in the city shrouded the double moons here in smoke, and the wheels ran over the ground, causing the ground to deform. The evil Cybertron, the winged arakkoa, the spike-skinned Goron, and other rare creatures haunt the edges of this world, hunting down edible prey. The mysterious draenei exile once built a seaside stronghold into a gleaming kingdom, which is filled with libraries and worship halls that record their eternal civilization. But later, the shackled slaves of the Iron Horde drove war equipment to attack Draenei and the outside world. Kingdoms, clans, tribes, men, women, and children have all entered a state of preparation.

            <h2>Legion</h2>
            <p>
                The Tomb of Sargeras opened again, and the demons of the Burning Legion poured into our world. Their powerful and terrifying power is enough to summon the Dark Titans to Azeroth-and they have found the key to Sargeras's return. Both the Alliance and the Horde ran out of power in the battle, only this world’s most legendary artifact, searching for the remains of Titan on the Broken Isles, challenging the Burning Legion, and defending the last hope of Azeroth
            </p>
            <h2>Battle for Azeroth  </h2>
            <p>
                The people of Azeroth paid a heavy price in order to prevent the Burning Legion from destroying the world. Even if the wounds of the world can be healed, the broken trust between the Alliance and the Horde is difficult to rebuild. The two sides have been grieving for a long time, and the conflict is about to break out. Hurry up and gather allies to fight for your camp-this war will forge the future of Azeroth.
            </p>
            <h2>Shadow Kingdom</h2>
            <p>
                Sylvanas Windrunner, the former warchief of the Horde, smashed the crown of the Lich King and pierced the curtain between Azeroth and the dead. Her move triggered a series of events and even threatened the balance of life and death in the universe.
